# CLI-To-Do
Proof of concept command line based implementation of Microsoft To Do using the Microsoft Graph API

Made this because I hated how long it takes to open the app and then create a reminder  
Also wanted to learn C# a bit 

Currently can only login and add tasks (The only features I planned on using)
