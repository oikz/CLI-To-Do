# CLI-To-Do
Proof of concept command line based implementation of Microsoft To Do using the Microsoft Graph API

Made this because I hated how long it takes to open the app and then create a reminder  
Also wanted to learn C# a bit 

Didn't exactly go to plan since I couldn't figure out how to persist the login between sessions properly  
Kinda useless if you need to login through the MS website every time :/  

May fix later but currently sits as a proof of concept only allowing login and creating tasks
